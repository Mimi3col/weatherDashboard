## Notes

I had the main page done, and as I was trying to connect the hourly page, my API will no longer pull data, I had the pro-plan for the [weatherbit](https://www.weatherbit.io/), So there is no reason for me to run out of calls. I will be working on this tomorrow as well, Possibly contact their support.
